Assignment 4 part 1
Minimum Cut algorithm using random contractions

Given a text file detailing a graph, what is the minimum cut of the graph?
The graph is assumed to be connected and undirected.
Return the number of edges crossed in the minumum cut

Input file is:
    - column1 in each row is the vertex id
    - the rest of the columns are verticies that it shares an edge with

The algorithm is random so it will need to be run a multiple times to get the minimum cut
Initially it is best to implement the contraction alorithm niavely by creating a new graph for each run
