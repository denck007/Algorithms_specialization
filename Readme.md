# Algorithms Specialization

These are my solutions to taking the Coursera Algorithms Specializaiton.

## Part 1: Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms


## Part 2: Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures


## Part 3: Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming


## Part 4: Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them

## Test cases
Inside of each course folder there are test case folders. These are take from [beaunus/stanford-algs](https://github.com/beaunus/stanford-algs/) listing of test cases.
