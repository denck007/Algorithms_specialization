'''
Course 3, Week1: INtro to greedy algorithms, Assignment 1: Q1 and Q2

Given a listing of positive weights and lengths for jobs, schedul the jobs using 2 different methods

Question 1: Schedule in decreasing order of weight-length
Question 2: Schedule in decreasing order of weight/length

Going to use the heap data structure from course 2 week 2

Go through and add jobs to heap bases on criteria, then extract them all off.
